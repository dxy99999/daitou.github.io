# Question 1

Lecture-5-page-14

When `sigma=1`, which means `rho` goes to 0, then the production function is  

$$
\lim_{\rho \rightarrow 0} (Y_l^{\rho}+Y_h^{\rho})^{\frac{1}{\rho}} = 2^{+\infty}=+\infty
$$

How do we know that it is in the form of Cobb-Douglas production function?

# Question 2

For the homogenous of degree one production function, we can get the following results:

$$
Y_{output} = MPK \cdot K + MPL \cdot L
$$

And in the competitive market we have 

$$
MPK = R \text{ and } MPL = w
$$

Then the household income is (suppose there is no depreciation):

$$
Y_{income} = RK+wL = Y_{output}
$$

Then it seems that the income is just equal to output only when we have a strictly homogenous production function? If the return to scale is not constant but increasing, then marginal pricing will lead to the income is larger than output?

$$
Y_{income}= RK+wL = MPK \cdot K + MPL \cdot L > Y_{output}
$$

It seems impossible for a closed system to yield an inequality of income and output?
